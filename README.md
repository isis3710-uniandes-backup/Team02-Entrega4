Practice of JWT

Hello, I hope you are having a great day.

In this repository you will find a little API implementing security requirements using JWT (Json Web Tokens)
To test its functionalities clone the repo and import the Postman test which are located in test/.

Get the dependencies using npm i

Enter to the repo and start it using npm start

There are three different roles in the API: admin, librarian and guest.

Following, the users registered are:

1. Admin: username = Geovanny; password = Test; role = admin.
2. Librarian: username = Maria; password = Test; role = librarian.
3. Guest: username = Pipo; password = Test; role = guest.

Admin have permissions to do all the operations, librarian can look for all books and the detailed info of all of them
and finally guest only can see the information of one specific book and just see its basic info.

Have a nice day

Geovanny
